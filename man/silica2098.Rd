\title{Nanoindentation measurements data}
\format{
The data frame contains two columns:
\describe{
  \item{Depth}{nanoindentation depth, in nanometers.}
  \item{Load}{load, in milinewtons.}
}

\description{
Load and depth measured with Berkovich diamond tip on fused silica material.
 Data contains only cutted part of unloading indentation curve from \code{silicaBerk} data (20 - 98\%, as recommended in
 ISO 14577 standard). The relationship between \emph{Load} (\emph{F}) and \emph{Depth} (\emph{h}) is given by equation
 \eqn{F = \alpha (h - h_p)^{m}}, where  \emph{h_p} is permanent indentation depth after
 removal of the load, \eqn{\alpha} is fitting constant related to the indenter geometry and
 power law exponent \emph{m} should be from (1,2) interval.
